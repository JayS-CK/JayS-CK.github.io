            I am a cloud infrastructure student looking to fill in skill gaps I have found in my job as a cloud engineer. I am also interested in expanding<br>
            my scripting and coding knowledge as well, with specific interest in Powershell, Python, and C++. I am working full-time, have a wife<br> and six-year
            old son, and am tired ALL the time.
