My Github account is used for collecting PowerShell and Python scripts that I have found or written previously. It is also used as a repository for my notes in the Obsidian app. I am also using it for this class
The repository I created for this class is empty for now except for the readme.md markdown file. 
I cloned the repository by going into Github Desktop, logging in, choosing this particular repository to clone, and chose the target folder to clone it into. I have also cloned repos in CLI using the `git clone` command and the url of the repo.
